#CAPSELLA Platform
CAPSELLA is an H2020 research project focusing on two complementary domains: agro-biodiversity and the food supply chain.
It will use participatory bottom up data collection and top down data integration to develop solutions for these domains. The project will build from scratch open data repositories concerning regional agro-biodiversity, and will build upon and enhance existing data sets on the agro-biodiversity and food domains. Based on these, the project will develop a number of community-driven data powered ICT solutions, which will be tested by the communities engaged in the project and will result in a number of pilots

CAPSELLA Platform is the core component of the systems and pilot applications to be developed during the projectâ€™s lifetime.
Aiming on supporting them, a rich set of functionalities and services will be offered, including data and metadata storage, access and search, social media data extraction and sentiment analysis.
